                <h2>Instagram accidentally hid likes while testing new feature </h2>

                        <img src = "../images/ig.jpg">

                        <div class="container-left-paragraf">

                            <p>Instagram is working on a lot of new features to enhance the user experience. While testing one of the features, an Instagram bug accidentally hid likes from some of its users. The company was testing the feature on a selected group of people but the bug added more people to the test contrary to the company’s plans.</p>
                            <p>The bug hid likes from the accounts of many users. While most people were flustered, some were happy not seeing the likes on their accounts. However, Instagram issued a clarification about the same on Twitter and wrote, “We've been testing a new experience to hide likes on Feed posts. We unintentionally added more people to the test today, which was a bug — we’re fixing this issue and restoring like counts to those people as soon as possible.”</p>
                            <p>Instagram is testing a new feature that would remove the number of likes from an account. In a screenshot shared by one of the users, Instagram sent a pop-up to users about the new feature. It read, “Testing a change to how you see likes”. “We want your followers to focus on what you share and not how many likes your posts get,” the note read. Instagram further said that during the test, only the account holder will see the total number of likes on his post. The number of likes on a post will not be visible to the followers of a particular account.</p>
                            <p>Some of the users in the United States spotted the pop-up about the new Instagram test. Hailing the new feature, one of the Twitter users wrote, “So Instagram took away likes destroying the popularity contest aspect... I love it”</p>
                            <p>Another user by the name of Demi Grace reacted to the new feature saying, “So Instagram got rid of likes and I honestly feel like that’s the most mentally progressive thing they’ve done all year.”</p>
                            <p>This is not the first time Instagram is testing a feature to remove likes from the profiles. The feature was tested in 2019. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri had said that the company wants to take care of users well being and mental health.</p>
